# Blog API Requirements

## Overview

Create a RESTful API for a blog management system that allows users to create, manage, and interact with blog posts. The system should support user authentication, post management, and tag-based categorization.

## Core Features

### User Management

1. User Registration

   - Users must be able to register with:
     - Email (unique)
     - Name
     - Password
   - Passwords must be securely hashed
   - Email must be validated for uniqueness

2. User Authentication
   - Users must be able to log in with email and password
   - System must return a JWT token for authenticated requests
   - All sensitive endpoints must require valid JWT token

### Blog Post Management

1. Post Creation

   - Authenticated users must be able to create new posts
   - Each post must contain:
     - Title
     - Content
     - Author (automatically set to current user)
     - Tags (optional)
     - Publication status (draft/published)

2. Post Operations
   - Users must be able to:
     - View all published posts
     - View a specific post by ID
     - Update their own posts
     - Delete their own posts

## Technical Requirements

### API Design

1. RESTful Endpoints

   - Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Follow RESTful naming conventions
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Include proper error messages

2. Response Format
   - All responses must be in JSON format
   - Include proper error handling

### Security

1. Authentication

   - Use JWT for authentication
   - Implement proper token validation
   - Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints

2. Authorization
   - Users can only modify their own posts
